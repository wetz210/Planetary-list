		<p class="solar-text txt solar-text-one">
			Welcome to our Solar System, visitor and/or Earthling.
			This small neighborhood of ours has been around for the past 4.6 billion years, though I suspect you don't remember how it looked prior to our coming here.
		</p>
		<p class="solar-text txt">
			We've built 8 beautiful planets (and one that we don't talk about); Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
		</p>
		<p class="solar-text txt">
			You're welcome to wander around. 
			Please don't loiter, as we have yet to figure out how to clean space trash.

			Caution: Hot.
		</p>
		<p class="sun-text txt">
			Over here to your left you can see our mighty star, we call it the Sun!
		</p>
		<p class="sun-text txt">
			Contrary to popular misconception, stars aren't globes of fire. Rather, they are radiating heat and light from a process called nuclear fusion.
		</p>
		<p class="sun-text txt">
			The Sun's radius is about 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

			Caution: Small.
		<p class="mercury-text txt">
			And over here to your right you can see our smallest planet, Mercury!
		</p>
		<p class="mercury-text txt">
			We've named it after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals.
		</p>
		<p class="mercury-text txt">
			Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974 and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over 4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015.

			Earth's long lost sister
		<p class="venus-text txt">
			Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is sometimes called Earth's "sister" or "twin" planet as it is almost as large and has a similar composition.
		</p>
		<p class="venus-text txt">
			As an interior planet to Earth, Venus (like Mercury) appears in Earth's sky never far from the Sun, either as morning star or evening star.
		</p>
		<p class="venus-text txt">
			 It was the first planet beyond Earth spacecrafts were sent to, starting with Venera 1 in 1961, and the first planet to be reached, impacted and in 1970 successfully landed on by Venera 7.

		<p class="mars-text txt">
			Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In the English language, Mars is named for the Roman god of war.
		</p>
		<p class="mars-text txt">
			Some of the most notable surface features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. 
		</p>
		<p class="mars-text txt">
			Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1 lander transmitted in 1976 the first images from the Martian surface.

			Has his (red) eye on you
		<p class="jupiter-text txt">
			Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
		</p>
		<p class="jupiter-text txt">
			Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume. It probably has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets in the Solar System, it lacks a well-defined solid surface. 
		</p>
		<p class="jupiter-text txt">
			Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored by multiple robotic spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later with the Galileo orbiter in 1995. In 2007, the New Horizons visited Jupiter using its gravity to increase its speed, bending its trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in July 2016.

			Put a ring on it
		<p class="saturn-text txt">
			Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth.
		</p>
		<p class="saturn-text txt">
			The planet's most notable feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn.
		</p>
		<p class="saturn-text txt">
			The exploration of Saturn has been solely performed by crewless probes. Three missions were flybys, which formed an extended foundation of knowledge about the system. The Cassiniâ€“Huygens spacecraft, launched in 1997, was in orbit from 2004 to 2017.

		<p class="uranus-text-one">
			Wants a different name
		<p class="uranus-text txt">
			Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus (Caelus), who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn).
		</p>
		<p class="uranus-text txt">
			Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the other giant planets.
		</p>
		<p class="uranus-text txt">
			Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the planet.

			Last one
		<p class="neptune-text txt">
			Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
		</p>
		<p class="neptune-text txt">
			Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation.
		</p>
		<p class="neptune-text txt">
			Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune.
